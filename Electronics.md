# Electronics

These electronics were developed organicaly, and evolved from a wired version of the board.
Along the prototyping process, I switched from an arduino Nano as the longboard controller to an arduino Pro mini 3.3v for both systems.

## Schematic

You can download a PDF version of the schematic [here](./media/CimmerDown_schematic.pdf).

## construction

Physically constructing the boards will require some [perfboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfboard), all the components, and some soldering.

here is a list of the electrical components:


| Component | Symbol | Quantity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10k ohm resistor | R[1-5] | 2 | |


## PCB

a PCB version of this might be on the way soon, but I don't know if there's enough interest to warrant it.
