This project transforms an Arduino Nano into a dual‐motor controller using two Rev Robotics SPARK ESCs, brushed motors, and a rotary encoder for intuitive throttle control. The system reads the encoder’s rotation to map position values into precise ESC PWM pulses (1000–2000 µs), ensuring smooth acceleration and braking. A status LED indicates throttle level and power, while a buzzer alerts at full throttle. The Nano is powered via a single ESC BEC output, and a hardware switch in the LiPo’s +12 V line provides safe power cutoff.
